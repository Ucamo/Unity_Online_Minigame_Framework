# Pokemon Stadium Minigames

This is a proof of concept of builiding a boilerplate for Unity using PUN so we could "make a minigame online" the fastest way possible.

I remade the "Egg emergency" mini game on Unity and implemented online functionabilities.

The goal of this project is re-using as much code as we can implementing other mini games, and make the project online functionabilities API agnostic, so we can switch between PUN and MLAPI.

However, at this stage, Web builds are only supported with PUN, and MLAPI implementations need to be built on Windows/Mac/Linux.

I have been writing about the progress of this project on this Twitter thread:
